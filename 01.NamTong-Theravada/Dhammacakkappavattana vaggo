Idaṃ kho pana, bhikkhave, dukkhaṃ ariya-saccaṃ: jāti-pi dukkhā, jarā-pi dukkhā (byādhi-pi dukkho) maraṇam-pi dukkhaṃ, a-p'piyehi sampayogo dukkho, piyehi vippayogo dukkho, yampicchaṃ na labhati tam-pi dukkhaṃ; saṃkhittena pañc'upādāna'k'khandhā dukkhā.

Idaṃ kho pana, bhikkhave, dukkha-samudayaṃ ariya-saccaṃ: Y'āyaṃ taṇhā ponobbhavikā nandi-rāga-sahagatā tatra-tatr'ābhinandinī, seyyathidaṃ: kāma-taṇhā, bhava-taṇhā, vibhava-taṇhā.

Idaṃ kho pana, bhikkhave, dukkha-nirodhaṃ ariya-saccaṃ: yo tassā-y'eva taṇhāya asesa-virāga-nirodho cāgo paṭinissaggo mutti anālayo.

Idaṃ kho pana, bhikkhave, dukkha-nirodha-gāminī paṭipadā ariya-saccaṃ: ayam'eva ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo, seyyathidaṃ: sammā-diṭṭhi sammā-saṅkappo sammā-vācā sammā-kammanto sammā-ājīvo sammā-vāyāmo sammā-sati sammā-samādhi. 

Furthermore, bhikkhus, this is the dukkha ariya-sacca: jāti is dukkha, aging is dukkha (sickness is dukkha) maraṇa is dukkha, association with what is disliked is dukkha, dissociation from what is liked is dukkha, not to get what one wants is dukkha; in short, the five upādāna'k'khandhas are dukkha.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, this is the dukkha-samudaya ariya-sacca: this taṇhā leading to rebirth, connected with desire and enjoyment, finding delight here or there, that is to say: kāma-taṇhā, bhava-taṇhā and vibhava-taṇhā.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, this is the dukkha-nirodha ariya-sacca: the complete virāga, nirodha, abandoning, forsaking, emancipation and freedom from that very taṇhā.
